# Event Tracker

This AI tool automatically compiles a list of events occurring in the near future and saves them into a spreadsheet. It specifically focuses on conferences, summits, and meetups relevant to deeptech, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and neurotechnology.

## Features

- Automated event discovery using AI agents
- Extracts key information including dates, locations, deadlines, and themes
- Saves data to a spreadsheet for easy tracking
- Monthly automatic updates
- Focus on scientific and technological events relevant to BCI and deeptech

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An Anthropic API key (for Claude AI)
- A Serper API key (for web search capabilities)
- Google Sheets API access (for spreadsheet updates)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pegger0709/event-tracker.git
cd event-tracker
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the project and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

5. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys to `.env`:
   ```
